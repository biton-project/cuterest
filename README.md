# CuteRest
CuteRest is a REST client tool dedicated for JSON 

## What it is
CuteRest is an opensource tool dedicated to communicate with a REST server. It's particulary useful to manage 
Json Request during developement step. Actually, They are several tool for this purpose. You can use plugins from
your browser, like Postman or use httpie as command-line from your console. But those application doesn't provide
a tree view for Json or XML response. YOu only have raw data, and you need to use another software, like 
http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/ to view your content as a tree.  
CuteRest have both. It's a REST client which have different view to parse the response.

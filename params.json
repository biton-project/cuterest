It's particulary useful to manage \r\nJson Request during developement step. Actually, They are several tool for this purpose. You can use plugins from\r\nyour browser, like [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm). or use [httpie](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie) as command-line from your console. But those application doesn't provide\r\na tree view for Json or XML response. YOu only have raw data, and you must use another software, like \r\n[jsonviewer](http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/) to view your content as a tree.  \r\nCuteRest have both. It's a REST client which have different view to parse the response.\r\n\r\nFeature\r\n* Http Verb supported : GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,HEAD,PATCH,OPTION \r\n* View as JSON Tree\r\n* View as XML Tree \r\n* HTML Web rendering\r\n* JSON syntax highlighter\r\n* XML syntax highlighter\r\n* Search by key or value inside the tree\r\n* Authentification: Basic,NTLM version 2 and Digest-MD5 \r\n* Proxy settings\r\n* View History\r\n* Save Request in Favorite\r\n* Import & Export favorte \r\n\r\n## Windows\r\nWindows binaries can be downloaded from here:\r\n[CuteRest-win32-beta-0.1.exe](https://github.com/dridk/cuterest/releases/download/v0.1-beta/CuteRest-win32-beta-0.1.exe)\r\n\r\n\r\n## MacOS X\r\nMac OS binaries can be downloaded from here:\r\n[CuteRest-beta-0.1.dmg](https://github.com/dridk/cuterest/releases/download/v0.1-beta/CuteRest-beta-0.1.dmg)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Linux\r\nCuteRest works well on Linux. There is not yet package avaible for distribution. I will publish a debian package\r\nas soon as possible. For now, you need to compile it as it's describe below. \r\n\r\n## from Source\r\nCompiling on Windows, OSX, Linux, and FreeBSD are really easy. But cutrest need a least Qt5.4 . Older version will generate complain during the compilation. \r\n* Download the community Qt 5.4 SDK from [qt.io](http://www.qt.io/download/)\r\n* Download the source code from master branch. \r\n* From Qt Creator , File > Open project  then select cuterest.pro\r\n* Compile and run it by clicking on the Green button\r\n\r\nIf you want to install it on your system. Compile and install it from the command line by using qmake your Qt installation path. \r\n    \r\n    qmake cuterest.pro\r\n    make\r\n    sudo make install\r\n\r\n## Twitter\r\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/dridk\r\n\r\n## Releases\r\n* [Version beta 0.1 released](https://github.com/dridk/cuterest/releases/tag/v0.1-beta) - 2015-04-06\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n*  Schutz alias [@dridk](https://github.com/dridk) Create all the Qt code\r\n* Eugene Trounev alias [@its](https://github.com/its) help for the design\r\n* Lucas Bourneuf alias [@Aluriak](https://github.com/its) help for the Json Tree model \r\n\r\n## License\r\nCuteRest is licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 3 or later.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
